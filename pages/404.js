          <p>Or it could have never existed in the first place.  Come to think of it, maybe none of this actually exists?  This could all be a really complex computer simulation, or something... ðŸ¤”</p>
          <p>Weird.  Anyways, if you are looking for another way to pass your simulation cycles, why not <Link href="/"><a>return home</a></Link> or check out <Link href="/blog"><a>the blog</a></Link>.</p>
