<!-- Post content -->

Hello, and thanks again for visiting my blog!  As we get started, I'd like to establish some ground rules...

## Who am I?

That's a tricky question.  Not trying to be philosophical or anything, but identity is complicated.  It's always felt weird to me that (as Americans), the go-to introduction is "I'm an X role at Y company".

Aren't we more than our 9-5's?

We have hobbies and dreams and fears and much more.  I'm still figuring out who I am, and maybe you are too.  But, if you'd like to read more about my background, the [About](/about) page is a good place to start.  And, as you may have already gathered, I'm a software developer by trade.

## Why the website?

At this point, I've been online for most of my life.  I've spent most of that time as a [lurker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurker), passively consuming the content of others, but never really creating my own.  This is a common phenonenom, so much so that it has been decribed as the ["1% rule"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)>); only a small handful of users create the posts that the rest of us enjoy on a daily basis.

I've been aware of this quality in myself for quite some time.  In fact, I built this blog over a year ago, at the end of 2020. But it's sat empty all this time.  I think much of that stems from a crippling fear of [being wrong on the internet](https://xkcd.com/386/).

**That was pretty silly, on my part.**

No one can completely avoid mistakes, that's only human!  It's also doing myself a disservice, as the potential to learn and improve is much greater when you let the world "check your math".  This idea is known as ["Learn in Public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), popularized by [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx).

And it's not just Shawn, many of [the people](https://twitter.com/Stammy/status/1393217964841787397) I follow have [extolled the power](https://www.fabrizio.so/notes/grow-on-twitter) of [this methodology](https://twitter.com/SimonHoiberg/status/1452218476807000067).

So I guess that's the disclaimer: **I don't have all the answers, and I'll never claim to be always right.**  The stuff here is based on the knowledge I have at the time, and I reserve the right to edit or change things as I learn more.  _Progress over perfection_.

## What can you expect?

If all of that sounds good to you, here's what you can expect content on:

**Anything that interests me**

Incredibly vague, right?  Well, I have a lot of ideas for articles, such as:

* How I built this site w/ Next.js & Tailwind
* Why I use a split, mechanical keyboard
* What's the deal with web3 anyways?
* How to make great epoxy tables
* The pitfalls and shortcomings of Infrastructure-as-Code

It's pretty tough for me to come up with one or two categories that work for all of that (if you have ideas, feel free to [tweet them at me!](https://twitter.com/maxpetretta)).  So instead, no promises other than sharing what I'm learning about.

## Wrapping up...

This year, instead of setting goals and spending the entire year trying to acheive them, I'm trying something different:

Writing is one of the habits I've decided to focus on.  I'm hoping that by sharing what I'm learning, I can reach a better understanding myself, and maybe help others along the way.  So cheers to 2022, let's see where we end up!
