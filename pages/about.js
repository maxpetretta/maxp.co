        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Max Petretta.  I'm a software engineer with ~5 years of professional work experience.  During that time, I've worked on a variety of projects in the web, mobile, and cloud fields.  Currently, I work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.gehealthcare.com/">GE Healthcare</a>.  My focus is in the cloud space, working to modernize our applications using automation & infrastructure-as-code.</p>
        <p>Originally from Michigan, I graduated with a B.S. in computer science from the <a href="https://umdearborn.edu/">University of Michigan</a>.  In our senior design competition, my team and our Android app were fortunate enough to win the <a href="https://umdearborn.edu/news/articles/senior-design-day-takes-students-beyond-books">Most Innovative Project</a> award.  While working towards my degree, I also studied abroad at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>.</p>
        <p>After graduating college, I joined GE's Digital Technology Leadership Program (DTLP), where I spent two years traveling around the country (and the globe!) working in different businesses & roles.  I currently live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I maintain a pretty diverse set of hobbies: I practice woodworking, I wire & assemble mechanical keyboards, and I'm an avid Premier League fan (<strong>#COYS</strong>).</p>
